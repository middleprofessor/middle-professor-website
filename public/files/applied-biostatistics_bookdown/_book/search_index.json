Walker 2018-09-17 Chapter 1 Statistical Modeling More cynically, one could also well ask “Why has medicine not adopted frequentist inference, even though everyone presents P-values and hypothesis tests?” My answer is: Because frequentist inference, like Bayesian inference, is not taught. Instead everyone gets taught a misleading pseudo-frequentism: a set of rituals and misinterpretations caricaturing frequentist inference, leading to all kinds of misunderstandings. – Sander Greenland We use statistics to learn from data with uncertainty. Traditional introductory textbooks in biostatistics implicitly or explicitly train students and researchers to “discover by p-value” using hypothesis tests (appendix xxx). Over the course of many chapters, the student is trained to use something like a dichotomous key to choose the correct “test” for the data at hand, compute a test statistic for their data, compute a \\(p\\)-value based on the test statistic, and compares the p-value to 0.05. Textbooks typically give very little guidance about what can be concluded if \\(p &lt; 0.05\\) or if \\(p &gt; 0.05\\), but many researchers conclude (incorrectly) they have “discovered” something if \\(p &lt; 0.05\\) but found “no effect” if \\(p &gt; 0.05\\). Researchers learn almost nothing useful from a hypothesis test. If we are investigating the effects of an increasingly acidified ocean on coral growth, \\(p=0.002\\) may be evidence that pH affects growth, but, from everything we know about pH and cell biology, it would be absurd to conclude from any data that ocean acidification does not affect growth. Instead, we want to know the magnitude of the effect and our uncertainty in estimating this magnitude. We can use this magnitude and uncertainty to make predictions about the future of coral reefs, under different scenarios of ocean acidification. We can use the estimated effects and uncertainty to model the consquences of the effects of acidification on coral growth on fish production or carbon cycling. The “discovery by p-value” strategy, or Null-Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST), has been criticized by statisticians for many, many decades. Nevertheless, introductory biostatistics textbooks written by both biologists and statisticians continue to organize textbooks around a collection of hypothesis tests, with little emphasis on estimation and uncertainty. 1.1 Statistical modeling with linear models This book is an introduction to the analysis of biological data using a statistical modeling approach. As an introduction, the focus will be linear models and extensions of the linear models including linear mixed models and generalized linear models. Here, I refer to all of these as “linear models” because all are a function of a linear predictor. Linear models are the engine behind many hypothesis tests but the emphasis in statistical modeling is estimation and uncertainty instead of test statistics and \\(p\\)-values. A modeling view of statistics is also more coherent than a dichotomous key strategy. Figure 1.1: A line vs. a linear model. (A) the line $y=-3.48X + 105.7 is drawn. (B) A linear model fit to the data. The model coefficients are numerically equal to the slope and intercept of the line in A. All students are familiar with the idea of a linear model from learning the equation of a line, which is \\[\\begin{equation} Y = mX + b \\tag{1.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(m\\) is the slope of the line and \\(b\\) is the \\(Y\\)-intercept. It is useful to think of equation (1.1) as a function that maps values of \\(X\\) to values of \\(Y\\). Using this function, if we input some value of \\(X\\), we always get the same value of Y as the output. A linear model is a function, like that in equation (1.1), that is fit to a set of data, often to model a process that generated the data or something like the data. The line in Figure 1.1A is just that, a line, but the line in Figure 1.1B is a model of the data in Figure 1.1B. The basic structure of a linear model is \\[\\begin{equation} Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X + \\varepsilon \\tag{1.2} \\end{equation}\\] A linear model has two parts: the “linear predictor” (\\(Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X\\)) and the “error” (\\(\\varepsilon\\)). The linear predictor part looks like the equation for a line except that I’ve used \\(\\beta_0\\) for the intercept and \\(\\beta_1\\) for the slope and I’ve put the intercept term first. This re-labeling and re-arrangement make the notation for a linear model more flexible for more complicated linear models. For example \\(Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\varepsilon\\) is a model where \\(Y\\) is a function of two \\(X\\) variables. As with the equation for a line, the linear predictor part of a linear model is a function that maps a value of \\(X\\) to a specific value of \\(Y\\). This mapped value is the expected value given a specific input value of \\(X\\). This is often written as \\(\\mathrm{E}[Y|X]\\). The error part of a linear model is a random variable that adds some random value to this expected value. Nothing about the model part of a linear model can predict its value. The inputs to a linear model (the \\(X\\) variables) have many names including “independent variables,” “predictor variables,”, “explanatory variables,” “treatment variables,” and “covariates”. The output of a linear model (the \\(Y\\) variable or variables if the model is multivariate) is the “dependent variable,” “response,” or “outcome.” The \\(\\beta\\) in the linear model are model parameters There can be additional parameters in more sophisticated models. The coefficients of the \\(X\\) in a linear model (\\(\\beta_1\\) in model (1.2)) are often called “the effects” (so \\(\\beta_1\\) is the effect of \\(X_1\\)). Although a linear model is a model of a data-generating process, linear models are not typically used to actually generate any data. Instead, when we use a linear model to understand something about a real dataset, we think of our data as one realization of a process that generates data like ours. A linear model is a model of that process. That said, it is incredibly useful to use linear models to create fake datasets for at least two reasons: to probe our understanding of statistical modeling generally and, more specifically, to check that a model actually creates data like that in the real dataset that we are analyzing. 1.1.1 Linear models are used for prediction, explanation, and description Researchers typically use linear models to understand relationships between one or more \\(Y\\) variables and one or more \\(X\\) variables. These relationships include Descriptive modeling. Sometimes a researcher merely wants to describe the relationship between \\(Y\\) and a set of \\(X\\) variables, perhaps to discover patterns. For example, the arrival of a spring migrant bird (\\(Y\\)) as a function of sex (\\(X_1\\)) and age (\\(X_2\\)) might show that males and younger individuals arrive earlier. Importantly, if another \\(X\\) variable is added to the model (or one dropped), the coefficients, and therefore, the precise description, will change. That is, the interpretation of a coefficient as a descriptor is conditional on the other covariates (\\(X\\) variables) in the model. In a descriptive model, there is no implication of causal effects and the goal is not prediction. Nevertheless, it is very hard for humans to discuss a descriptive model without using causal language, which probably means that it is hard for us to think of these models as mere description. Like natural history, descriptive models are useful as patterns in want of an explanation, using more explicit causal models including experiments. Predictive modeling. Predictive modeling is very common in applied research. For example, fisheries researchers might model the relationship between population density and habitat variables to predict which subset of ponds in a region are most suitable for brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) reintroduction. The goal is to build a model with minimal prediction error, which is the error between predicted and actual values for a future sample. In predictive modeling, the \\(X\\) (“predictor”) variables are largely instrumental – how these are related to \\(Y\\) is not a goal of the modeling, although sometimes an investigator may be interested in the relative importance among the \\(X\\) for predicting \\(Y\\) (for example, collecting the data may be time consuming, or expensive, or enviromentally destructive, so know which subset of \\(X\\) are most important for predicting \\(Y\\) is a useful strategy). Explanatory (causal) modeling. Very often, researchers are explicitly interested in how the \\(X\\) variables are causally related to \\(Y\\). The fisheries researchers that want to reintroduce trout may want to develop and manage a set of ponds to maintain healthy trout populations. This active management requires intervention to change habitat traits in a direction, and with a magnitude, to cause the desired response. This model is predictive – a specific change in \\(X\\) predicts a specific response in \\(Y\\) – because the coefficients of the model provide knowledge on how the system functions – how changes in the inputs cause change in the output. Causal interpretation of model coefficients requires a set of strong assumptions about the \\(X\\) variables in the model. These assumptions are typically met in experimental designs but not observational designs. With observational designs, biologists are often not very explicit about which of these is the goal of the modeling and use a combination of descriptive, predictive, and causal language to describe and discuss results. Many papers read as if the researchers intend explanatory inference but because of norms within the biology community, mask this intention with “predictive” language. Here, I advocate embracing explicit, explanatory modeling by being very transparent about the model’s goal and assumptions. 1.2 Model fitting In order to use a linear model to describe, predict, or explain, we need to fit a model to data in order to estimate the parameters. If we fit model (1.3) to some data, the estimated parameters are the coefficients (\\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\)) of the fit model \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{E}[Y|X] = b_0 + b_1 X \\tag{1.3} \\end{equation}\\] The left-hand side of equation (1.3) is the conditional expectation and is read as “the expectation of Y given X” or “the expected value of Y given X”. Throughout this book, I use the greek \\(\\beta\\) to refer to a theoretical, data-generating parameter and the roman “b” to refer its estimate. The goal of descriptive and explanatory modeling is the estimate of the coefficients of the \\(X\\) variables and their uncertainty. The goal of predictive modeling is the estimate of predicted values, and their uncertainty, given specific values of \\(X\\). These predicted values are the conditional expectations. Figure 1.2: HarrellPlot of vole data. For the model fit to the data in Figure 1.1B, the coefficient of \\(X\\) is the slope of the line. Perhaps surprisingly, we can fit a model like equation (1.2) to data in which the \\(X\\) variable is categorical. A simple example is the experiment of antioxidants (vitamins C and E) on lifespan in Voles (Fig. 1.2). In this experiment, the \\(X\\) variable is categorical, with three levels: “Control”, “Vitamin_E” and “Vitamin_C”. Categorical \\(X\\) variables are often called factors. The trick to using a linear model with categorical \\(X\\) is to recode the factor levels into numbers – how this is done is explained in Chapter xxx. When the \\(X\\) variable is categorical, the coefficients of the \\(X\\) are differences in group means. The linear model fit to the vole data has two coefficients, one for Vitamin E and one for vitamin C. The estimate and uncertainty of the these two coefficients are shown in the top part of Figure 1.2. The bottom part shows the raw data, as well as the group (factor level) means and the uncertainty in the estimate of these means. The simplest possible model that can be fit to the data is \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{E}[Y] = b_0 \\tag{1.4} \\end{equation}\\] which is simply the mean of \\(Y\\), or, more specifically, the unconditional mean of \\(Y\\), since its value is not conditional on any value of \\(X\\). 1.2.1 “Statistical model” not “regression model” Statistical modeling terminology can be confusing. The \\(X\\) variables in a statistical model may be quantitative (continuous or integers) or categorical (names or qualitative amounts) or some mix of the two. Linear models with all quantitative independent variables are often called “regression models.” Linear models with all categorical independent variables are often called “ANOVA models.” Linear models with a mix of quantitative and categorical variables are often called “ANCOVA models” if the focus is on one of the categorical \\(X\\) or “regression models” if there tend to be many independent variables. Other patterns occur. For example “ANCOVA models” often include interaction effects but “regression models” rarely do. To avoid thinking of statistical analysis as “regression vs. ANOVA”, I will most often use the term “statistical model” for general usage, and use a more specific term only to emphasize something about the model in that particluar context. 1.3 Multilevel models 1.4 Linear models versus non-linear models In this text, I use “linear model” for any model that is linear in the parameters, which means that the different components of the model are added together. Or, using the language of matrix algebra, the predictor is a simple dot product of the model matrix and the coefficients. For example, a cubic polynomial model \\[\\begin{equation} Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X + \\beta_2 X^2 + \\beta_3 X^3 + \\varepsilon \\end{equation}\\] is a linear model, even though the function is non-linear, because the different components are added (or, using matrix algebra, the predictor is \\(\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\)). A generalized linear model (GLM) has the form \\(g(\\mu_i) = \\eta_i\\) where \\(\\eta\\) (the greek letter eta) is the linear predictor, which is linear in the parameters. \\[\\begin{equation} \\eta = \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} \\end{equation}\\] Many sources do not consider a GLM to be a “linear model” but an “extension” of a linear model. Regardless, a GLM is linear in the parameters and here, I include GLMs under the “linear model” umbrella. Non-linear models, in conrast to a GLM or classical linear model, are not linear in the parameters (the predictor is not a simple dot product of the model matrix and a vector of parameters). For example, the Michaelis-Menten model is a nonlinear model \\[\\begin{equation} Y = \\frac{\\beta_1 X}{\\beta_2 + X} + \\varepsilon \\end{equation}\\] "],

These packages need to be downloaded from an internet server to your computer. You only need to do this once. But, each time you start a new R session, you will need to load a package using the library() function. Now is a good time to import packages that we will use Open R Studio and choose the menu item “Tools” &gt; “Install Packages” In the “packages” input box, insert “ggplot2, data.table, emmeans, lme4, reshape2”. Make sure that “install dependencies” is clicked before you click “Install” Again, once these are installed, you don’t need to do this again. You simply need to use the library() function at the start of a script. 2.2 Create an R Studio Project for this Class Create a folder named “BIO_413” Within this folder, create new folders named “notebooks” – this is where your R notebooks are stored “R” – this is where R scripts are stored “data” – this is where data that we download from public archives are stored “output” – this is where you will store fake data generated in this class “images” – this is where image files are stored Open R Studio and click the menu item File &gt; New Project… Choose “Existing Directory” and navigate to your BIO_413 folder Choose “Create Project” Check that a file named “BIO_413.Rproj” is in your BIO_413 folder 2.3 R Notebooks A typical statistical modeling project will consist of: reading data from Excel or text (.csv or .txt) files cleaning data analysis generating plots generating tables writing text to describe the project, the methods, the analysis, and the interpretation of the results (plots and tables) The best practice for reproducible research is to have all six of these steps in your R Notebook. Too many research projects are not reproducible because the data were cleaned in Excel, and then different parts of the data were separately imported into a GUI statistics software for analysis, and then output from the statistics software was transcribed to Excel to make a table. And other parts of the analysis are used to create a plot in some plotting software. And then the tables and plots are pasted into Microsoft Word to create a report. Any change at any step in this process will require the researcher to remember all the downstream parts that are dependent on the change and to re-do an analysis, or a table, or a plot, etc. etc. The goal with an R Studio Notebook is to explicitly link all this so that changes in earlier steps automatically flow into the later steps. So, at the end of a project, a researcher can choose “run all” from the menu and the data are read, cleaned, analyzed, ploted, tabled, and put into a report with the text. This means that you have to think of the organization of the R code that your write in a Notebook. Your cannot simply append new code to the end of a script if something earlier (or above) is dependent on it. You need to go back up and insert the new code at some earlier (and meaningful) point. For example, an R chunk generates 100 random normal values and then plots these with a histogram. This was the chunk that I wrote x &lt;- rnorm(n) qplot(x) When I ran the chunk, I got the error “Error in rnorm(n) : object n not found”. I was using the function rnorm() to generate values but I hadn’t assigned any value to n yet, so I got the error. To get this to work properly, I could have just typed n &lt;- 100 in the console and then re-run the script but I want it to work properly on a fresh run of the chunk (after quitting and re-opening R Studio) so I instead inserted n &lt;- 100 at the start of the chunk, like this: n &lt;- 100 x &lt;- rnorm(n) qplot(x) 2.3.1 Create an R Notebook for this Chapter The top-left icon in R Studio is a little plus sign within a green circle. Click this and choose “R Notebook” from the pull-down menu. Change the title of the notebook to “Notebook_01-organization” Delete the default R Markdown text starting with “This is an [R Markdown]…” Now write some text documenting which packages you installed. 2.3.2 Create a “setup” chunk Click on the “Insert” menu on the right hand side of the script (R Markdown) pane and choose “R”. This will insert an R code chunk into your R markdown document. The first R chunk of a notebook should be a setup chunk. Name the chunk “setup” load the libraries ggplot2 and data.table and click the chunk’s run button (the green triangle to the right of the chunk) library(ggplot2) library(data.table) I added the chunk option “message=FALSE”. Run your chunk with and without this as an option. 2.3.3 Create a “simple plot” chunk Create a new chunk and label it “simple plot” insert the following R script and then click the chunk’s run button. Do you get a plot? n &lt;- 100 x &lt;- rnorm(n) qplot(x) ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. 2.3.4 Create more R chunks and explore options and play with R code "],

My own view is that all data should be archived on some public server (exceptions include data that are proprietary or contain sensitive information – such as human health measures). The downloaded data will be inserted into the “data” folder. To access these data in an R script, the script needs to know “where to look” or the “address.” This address is the directory path. The default path for an R notebook is the directory containing the notebook .Rmd file. This file should be in the “notebooks” folder within “BIO_413”. The “BIO_413” Folder is the parent of the “notebooks” folder. It is also the parent of the “data” folder. To see any content within the “data” folder, the R script needs to tell R to move back (or up) the directory structure out of the “notebooks” folder into the parent “BIO_413” folder and then forward (or down) into the “data” folder. This is done with data_path &lt;- &quot;../data&quot; The .. moves the address (of where to read input or write output) back one step and /data moves the address forward into the “data” folder. This folder will eventually contains lots of data from Dryad Digital Repository. 3.2.1 Excel File The Excel dataset is from an experiment on the growth response of zebra finch chicks to an incubation call that presumably signals “hot environment” to the embryos (Mariette, M.M. and Buchanan, K.L., 2016. Prenatal acoustic communication programs offspring for high posthatching temperatures in a songbird. Science, 353(6301), pp.812-814). The source file is from the Dryad Repository here: file name: “allDatasetsMarietteBuchanan2016.xls” source: https://datadryad.org//handle/10255/dryad.122315 Steps Copy the title of the Dryad page, which is “Data from: Prenatal acoustic communication programs offspring for high post-hatching temperatures in a songbird” Create a new folder within “data” and paste in the copied title as the folder name Remove the colon from the name, so the folder name is “Data from Prenatal acoustic communication programs offspring for high post-hatching temperatures in a songbird” Download the .xls file into this folder A .xls file is an old (pre 2007) Microsoft Excel file type. It is a binary file and can only be opened into a readable format with specialized software. The more modern Excel file type is .xlsx, which contains within it multiple xml components. An xml file is a text file, and so contains readable content, but the content is xml code to display something. In general, I am a big advocate of archiving stuff as text files (manuscripts, data, scripts, blog posts) because these will always be readable by future software. Microsoft Excel is not likely to die anytime soon and software that can read .xls and especially .xlsx files (again, .xlsx files are text files) is even less likely to disappear but we can feel even more confident if data are archived as text files. That said, a single microsoft excel file with multiple sheets is an efficient method for distributing data and the readxl package provides excellent tools for reading different sheets of a single .xls or .xlsx file. The code below uses the function read_excel() from the package readxl. More about the amazing power of this package is the tidyverse page and chapter 11 in the R for Data Science book. data_folder &lt;- &quot;Data from Prenatal acoustic communication programs offspring for high post-hatching temperatures in a songbird&quot; filename &lt;- &quot;allDatasetsMarietteBuchanan2016.xls&quot; file_path &lt;- paste(data_path, data_folder, filename, sep=&quot;/&quot;) chick &lt;- data.table(read_excel(file_path, sheet=&quot;nestlingMass&quot;)) head(chick) # check -- are there headers? are there the correct number of columns? ## chick ID brood ID brood composition sex rank in nest ## 1: N1.10LF3 N1.10m3 mixed F 2 ## 2: N1.10noCut3 N1.10m3 mixed M 4 ## 3: N1.10RB3 N1.10m3 mixed F 2 ## 4: N1.10RF3 N1.10m3 mixed F 5 ## 5: N1.12LB3 N1.12m3 mixed F 3 ## 6: N1.12LF3 N1.12m3 mixed F 1 ## playback treatment nest temperature above ambient ## 1: treat 4.289583 ## 2: cont 4.289583 ## 3: cont 4.289583 ## 4: cont 4.289583 ## 5: cont 3.972917 ## 6: treat 3.972917 ## max daily temp hatch day mean max temp hatch to day2 ## 1: 17.4 18.83333 ## 2: 19.0 20.53333 ## 3: 17.4 18.83333 ## 4: 19.0 20.53333 ## 5: 29.0 24.63333 ## 6: 25.1 24.80000 ## mean max temp hatch to day10 mean max temp hatch to day13 hatching mass ## 1: 22.70 23.05714 0.7 ## 2: 24.53 23.41429 0.6 ## 3: 22.70 23.05714 0.7 ## 4: 24.53 23.41429 0.6 ## 5: 22.85 22.91429 0.7 ## 6: 23.35 23.24286 0.6 ## day1 mass day2 mass day10 mass day13 mass day13 tarsus ## 1: 1.1 1.2 NA 9.8 14.11 ## 2: 0.8 1.1 NA 9.1 12.90 ## 3: 0.9 1.4 NA 9.3 13.60 ## 4: 0.5 0.9 NA 7.7 13.06 ## 5: 1 1.4 9.4 10.1 14.08 ## 6: 0.9 1.4 8.1 9.6 13.46 NOTE If you are getting errors when trying to read a file, it is probably a bug in the construction of the variable file_path, which is a string variable and the value has to be exactly match the directly path to the file you are trying to read. file_path is constructed by pasting together the variables data_path, data_folder, and filename. Type file_path into the console and look at the value. Then check Spelling. Humans are very good at understanding misspelled words but the R language (or any computer language) is very literal. “../data” does not equal “./data” or “../ data” or “../data” Capitalization. R is case sensitive (some programming languages are not). “../data” does not equal “../Data” or “../DATA”. is the file you are trying to read actually in the folder you are trying to read from? is the notebook that you are writing in the folder “notebooks”? (the construction of file_path assumes that notebook is one folder deep within the project folder. If the spelling or capitalization of any of these components is wrong, then file_path will be wrong. If there is any difference in any character in the string, then R will return an error. So spelling AND capitalization have to be perfect, not simply close. Humans are very good at understanding misspelled and OdDLy capitalized words but the R language (or any computer language) is very literal. In this book, we will consistently uses the protocol for storing and retrieving downloaded files. The first three lines in the script above creates the directory path to the file. This path includes data_path – the relative path into the folder “data” (relative to the location of the notebook file) data_folder – the name of the folder within “data” containing the file filename – the name of the file to read These are all put together into a single path using the function paste(). Read about paste. It will be used repeatedly. The read_excel(file_path, sheet=&quot;nestlingMass&quot;) reads the nestlingMass sheet only. This function is embedded within the data.table() function and so is converted into a data.table. The data.table is assigned to the object “chick” The head(chick) script simply displays the first few lines of the data.table. This is one way to check that the data were imported correctly. In this case, it is easy to see that the column names have spaces in them. It can sometimes be hard to work with column names with spaces and so this next line of code changes all spaces to an underscore setnames(chick, old=colnames(chick), new=gsub(&quot; &quot;, &quot;_&quot;, colnames(chick))) Resist the temptation to change the column names in the data file, which reduces reproducibility. Always increase reproducibility! Just for fun, let’s plot the data and reproduce Fig. 2A and B. We are using the qplot function, which is from the ggplot2 package. Two plots are made and only a subset of the rows are plotted in each (in A, the subset in which playback_treatment==“treat” and, in B, the subset in which playback_treatment==“cont”). This book uses the ggplot2 package extensively. qplot(x=nest_temperature_above_ambient, y=day13_mass, data=chick[playback_treatment==&quot;treat&quot;]) + geom_smooth(method=&quot;lm&quot;) qplot(x=nest_temperature_above_ambient, y=day13_mass, data=chick[playback_treatment==&quot;cont&quot;]) + geom_smooth(method=&quot;lm&quot;) 3.2.2 Text File The example dataset comes from an experiment on the effect of neonicotinoid pesticides on bumble bee colony growth. file name: “Whitehorn, O’Connor, Wackers, Goulson (2012) Data from ‘Neonicotinoid pesticide reduces bumblebee colony growth and queen production’.csv.csv” source: https://datadryad.org//resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.1805c973 Steps Copy the title of the Dryad page, which is “Data from: Neonicotinoid pesticide reduces bumblebee colony growth and queen production” Create a new folder within “data” and paste in the copied title as the folder name Remove the colon from the name, so the folder name is “Data from Neonicotinoid pesticide reduces bumblebee colony growth and queen production” Download the .csv file into this folder A .csv file is a text file that is comma-delimted, which means that the entries of a row are separated by commas. A text file is readable by any text editor software and most other kinds of software. Datasets that are stored as text files are typically saved as either .csv (where the entries of a row are separated by commas) or .txt (where the entries are separated by tabs). The base R way to read a .csv file is using read.csv. The read.table function is more versatile, as the delimiter can be specified. The function fread() from the data.table package is fast, smart, and flexible. It is smart in the sense that it guesses what the delimter is. Unfortunately, because of spaces in the column labels for this file, fread guesses incorrectly (another reason why spaces in column labels should be avoided). To overcome this, the statement below specifies that the file contains a “header” (a line containing column labels) data_folder &lt;- &quot;Data from Neonicotinoid pesticide reduces bumblebee colony growth and queen production&quot; filename &lt;- &quot;Whitehorn, O&#39;Connor, Wackers, Goulson (2012) Data from &#39;Neonicotinoid pesticide reduces bumblebee colony growth and queen production&#39;.csv.csv&quot; file_path &lt;- paste(data_path, data_folder, filename, sep=&quot;/&quot;) bee &lt;- fread(file_path, header=TRUE) bee[, Treatment:=factor(Treatment, c(&quot;Control&quot;, &quot;Low&quot;, &quot;High&quot;))] head(bee) ## Treatment Nest ID No. workers 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 ## 1: Control C1 13 712.95 748.30 800.57 865 966 997 850 ## 2: Control C2 14 719.58 750.00 789.25 822 812 846 827 ## 3: Control C3 17 704.92 736.31 767.99 837 976 1117 1050 ## 4: Control C4 20 726.42 763.31 795.60 813 801 784 NA ## 5: Control C5 28 740.60 785.52 808.42 837 871 906 886 ## 6: Control C6 15 727.10 751.90 774.80 807 847 859 827 ## 7 8 V13 Workers left Males New queens Total unhatched pupae ## 1: 791 775 NA 2 0 1 NA ## 2: 820 802 NA 6 15 0 20 ## 3: 866 808 NA 1 0 9 NA ## 4: NA NA NA 0 0 0 12 ## 5: 807 775 NA 3 0 0 NA ## 6: NA NA NA 0 0 0 118 ## Queen pupae Empty cells ## 1: NA NA ## 2: 0 120 ## 3: NA NA ## 4: 0 72 ## 5: NA NA ## 6: 20 132 Here, as with the import of the Excel file, the first three lines create the directory path to the file. The treatment column is a factor variable containing three levels (Control, Low, and High). R automatically orders these alphabetically. For plotting and analysis, we might want a different order. For example, we want Control to be first in the order, since this is a natural “reference” level (what everything is compared to). And if we think of “Control” as no treatment, then it makes sense to have “Low” second in order and “Hight” last in order. The line bee[, Treatment:=factor(Treatment, c(&quot;Control&quot;, &quot;Low&quot;, &quot;High&quot;))] re-orders these levels to this more meaningful order. Again, there are spaces in the column names. Here I’ll leave it to you to change this Here is a reproduction of Fig 2. ggbarplot(data=bee, x=&quot;Treatment&quot;, y=&quot;New_queens&quot;, add = c(&quot;mean_se&quot;)) The plot suggests immediately some problems with the plot itself and the associated analysis. First, the y-axis is counts, which means that negative values are impossible. But the standard error bars look like they use standard errors computed from a model that allows infinetly large negative values, and the illustrated standard error bars imply that negative values exist. So these error bars are misleading. Second, it is good practice, especially if sample sizes are modest or small, to “show the data”, which means, show the individual data points and not just a summary of the distribution. Here are three alternative plots for exploratory purposes. The first simply “shows the data” but still uses the misleading standard error bars. The second uses a box plot. The last plots the means and 95% confidence intervals modeled with a GLM (generalized linear model) to account for the count data (the model used could be improved). Notice that the bar length above the mean is longer than the bar length below the mean (that is the interval is asymmetric about the mean). In order to stay focussed on importing data, I leave explanation of these plots and analysis to later chapters. ggbarplot(data=bee, x=&quot;Treatment&quot;, y=&quot;New_queens&quot;, add = c(&quot;mean_se&quot;, &quot;point&quot;)) ggboxplot(data=bee, x=&quot;Treatment&quot;, y=&quot;New_queens&quot;) fit.glm &lt;- glm(New_queens ~ Treatment, data=bee, family=poisson()) means.glm &lt;- emmeans(fit.glm, specs=&quot;Treatment&quot;, type = &quot;response&quot;) gg &lt;- ggplot(data=data.frame(means.glm), aes(x=Treatment, y=rate)) + geom_col(fill=&quot;gray&quot;) + geom_errorbar(aes(x=Treatment, ymin=asymp.LCL, ymax=asymp.UCL), width=0.3) + ylab(&quot;New queens&quot;) + NULL gg 3.3 Creating Fake Data 3.3.1 Continuous X (fake observational data) A very simple simulation of a regression model n &lt;- 25 beta_0 &lt;- 25 beta_1 &lt;- 3.4 sigma &lt;- 2 x &lt;- rnorm(n) y &lt;- beta_0 + beta_1*x + rnorm(n, sd=sigma) qplot(x, y) knitr::kable(coefficients(summary(lm(y ~ x))), digits=2) Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|) (Intercept) 24.46 0.39 62.43 0 x 3.05 0.37 8.25 0 The coefficient of \\(x\\) is the “Estimate”. How close is the estimate? Run the simulation several times to look at the variation in the estimate – this will give you a sense of the uncertainty. Increase \\(n\\) and explore this uncertainty. Increase all the way up to \\(n=10^5\\). Commenting out the qplot line will make this exploration easier. 3.3.2 Categorical X (fake experimental data) n &lt;- 5 fake_data &lt;- data.table(Treatment=rep(c(&quot;control&quot;, &quot;treated&quot;), each=n)) beta_0 &lt;- 10.5 # mean of untreated beta_1 &lt;- 2.1 # difference in means (treated - untreated) sigma &lt;- 3 # the error standard deviation # the Y variable (&quot;Response&quot;) is a function of treatment.

Here it is coded in R fake_data[, Response:=X%*%beta + rnorm(n, sd=sigma)] # plot it with a strip chart (often called a &quot;dot plot&quot;) ggstripchart(data=fake_data, x=&quot;Treatment&quot;, y=&quot;Response&quot;, add = c(&quot;mean_se&quot;)) # fit using base R linear model function fit &lt;- lm(Response ~ Treatment, data=fake_data) # display a pretty table of the coefficients knitr::kable(coefficients(summary(fit)), digits=3) Estimate Std.

This coefficient is the different in means between the treatment levels. It is the simulated effect. Again, change \\(n\\). Good values are \\(n=20\\) and \\(n=100\\). Again, comment out the plot line to make exploration more efficient. 3.4 Saving Data Let’s save the fake data to the “Fake_Data” folder. In the “output” folder create a new folder named “week 01”. Then set the path to the output folder: output_path &lt;- &quot;../output&quot; # out to parent directory than down into Fake_data This could be done at the beginning of the notebook, especially if many output files are saved. Regardless, now complete the file_path with the specifics of this save. data_folder &lt;- &quot;week 01&quot; filename &lt;- &quot;my_first_fake_data.txt&quot; file_path &lt;- paste(output_path, data_folder, filename, sep=&quot;/&quot;) write.table(fake_data, file_path, sep=&quot;\\t&quot;, quote=FALSE) We used write.table() to create a tab-delimited text file using sep=&quot;\\t&quot; to specify tabs to separate the row elements. “” is the standard character string for a tab. Check in your Fake_Data folder and open the file in a text editor. 3.5 Problems Download the dataset “data-Lodjak.et.al-2016-FuncEcol.xlsx” from the Dryad repository at https://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.rd01s. The .xlsx file presents the data cleanly but the trade-off is that the 1) multiple header rows, and 2) spaces in the header labels, 3) parentheses in the header labels make it more complex to import in a usable way. Import the data and plot Body Mass against Age (that is make Body Mass the “Y” variable and Age the “X” variable) using the qplot function. You should recode the column labels to remove spaces and parentheses using the setnames function. Download the dataset “Results2015.txt” from the Dryad repository at https://datadryad.org//resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.65vk4. Try to reproduce Fig. 1. It’s not easy. I’ve inserted the figure below. (grad students only) Download and plot data from a Dryad Repository dataset of your choice. (grad students only) Create fake experimental data with three treatment levels (control, lo_temp, high_temp). This will require three parameters: an intercept (beta_0), an effect of lo_temp (beta_1), and an effect of high_temp (beta_2). You should be able to plug and play from the script above even if you don’t underdstand at this point what any of it is! Plot it as a strip chart, as above.

A major goal of statistics is measuring uncertainty. What do we mean by uncertainty? Uncertainty is the error in estimating a parameter, such as the mean of a sample, or the difference in means between two experimental treatments, or the predicted response given a certain change in conditions. Uncertainty is measured with a variance or its square root, which is a standard deviation. The standard deviation of a statistic is also (and more commonly) called a standard error. Uncertainty emerges because of variability. In any introductory statistics class, students are introduced to two measures of variability, the “standard deviation” and the “standard error.” These terms are absolutely fundamental to statistics – they are the start of everything else. Yet, many biology professors confuse these terms and certainly, introductory students do too. When a research biologist uses the term “standard deviation,” they are probably referring to the sample standard deviation which is a measure of the variability of a sample. When a research biologist uses the term “standard error,” they are probably referring to the standard error of a mean, but it could be the standard error of another statistics, such as a regression slope. An important point to remember and understand is that all standard errors are standard deviations. This will make more sense soon. 4.1 The sample standard deviation vs. the standard error of the mean 4.1.1 Sample standard deviation The sample standard deviation is a measure of the variability of a sample. For example, were we to look at a histological section of skeletal muscle we would see that the diameter of the fibers (the muscle cells) is variable. We could use imaging software to measure the diameter of a sample of 100 cells and get a distribution like this The mean of this sample is 69.4 and the standard deviation is 2.8. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, and so computed by \\[\\begin{equation} s_y = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n{(y_i - \\overline{y})^2}}{n-1}} \\tag{4.1} \\end{equation}\\] Memorize this equation. To understand the logic of this measure of variability, note that \\(y_i - \\overline{y}\\) is the deviation of the \\(i\\)th value from the sample mean, so the numerator is the sum of squared deviations. The numerator is a sum over \\(n\\) items and the denominator is \\(n-1\\) so the variance is (almost!) an averaged squared deviation. More variable samples will have bigger deviations and, therefore, bigger average squared deviations. Since the standard deviation is the square root of the variance, a standard deviation is the square root of an average squared deviation. This makes it similar in value to the averaged deviation (or average of the absolute values of the deviations since the average deviation is, by definition of a mean, zero). Notes on the variance and standard deviation Variances are additive but standard deviations are not. This means that the variance of the sum of two independent (uncorrelated) random variables is simply the sum of the variances of each of the variables. This is important for many statistical analyses. The units of variance are the square of the original units, which is awkward for interpretation. The units of a standard deviation is the same as that of the original variable, and so is much easier to interpet. For variables that are approximately normally distributed, we can map the standard deviation to the quantiles of the distribution. For example, 68% of the values are within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% of the values are within two standard deviations, and 99% of the values are within three standard deviations. 4.1.2 Standard error of the mean A standard error of a statistic is a measure of the precision of the statistic. The standard error of the mean is a measure of the precision of the estimate of the mean. The smaller the standard error, the more precise the estimate. The standard error of the mean (SEM) is computed as \\[\\begin{equation} SEM = \\frac{s_y}{\\sqrt{n}} \\tag{4.2} \\end{equation}\\] The SEM is often denoted \\(s_{\\bar{y}}\\) to indicate that it is a standard deviation of the mean (\\(\\bar{y}\\)). In what sense is a standard error a measure of variability? This is kinda weird. If we sample 100 cells in the slide of muscle tissue and compute the mean diameter, how can the mean have a standard deviation? There is only one value! To understand how the SEM is a standard deviation, imagine 1) resampling 100 cells and 2) recomputing a mean from the re-sampled data an infinite number of times and each time, you write down the newly computed mean. The true standard error of the mean is the standard deviation of this infinitely long column of means. This means that a standard error of the mean, computed from a single sample using equation (4.2) is itself a sample statistic. Notes on standard errors The SEM is only one kind of standard error. A standard deviation can be computed for any statistic – these are all standard errors. For some statistics, such as the mean, the standard error can be computed directly using an equation, such as that for the SEM (equation (4.2). For other statistics, a computer intensive method such as the bootstrap is necessary to compute a standard error. We will return to the bootstrap at the end of this chapter. The units of a standard error are the units of the measured variable. A standard error is proportional to sample variability (the sample standard deviation, \\(s_y\\)) and inversely proportional to sample size (\\(n\\)). Sample variability is a function of both natural variation (there really is variation in diameter among fibers in the quadriceps muscle) and measurement error (imaging software with higher resolution can measure a diameter with less error). Since the SEM is a measure of the precision of estimating a mean, this means this precision will increase (or the SEM will decrease) if 1) an investigator uses methods that reduce measurement error and 2) an investigator computes the mean from a larger sample. This last point (the SEM decreases with sample size) seems obvious when looking at equation (4.2), since \\(n\\) is in the denominator. Of course \\(n\\) is also in the denominator of equation (4.1) for the sample standard deviation but the standard deviation does not decrease as sample size increases. First this wouldn’t make any sense – variability is variability. A sample of 10,000 cell diameters should be no more variable than a sample of 100 cell diameters (think about if you agree with this or not). Second, this should also be obvious from equation (4.1). The standard deviation is the square root of an average and averages don’t increase with the number of things summed since both the the numerator (a sum) and denominator increase with \\(n\\). 4.2 Using Google Sheets to generate fake data to explore uncertainty In statistics we are interested in estimated parameters of a population using measures from a sample. The goal in this section is to use Google Sheets (or Microsoft Excel) to use fake data to discover the behavior of sampling and to gain some intuition about uncertainty using standard errors. 4.2.1 Steps Open Google Sheets In cell A1 type “mu”. mu is the greek letter \\(\\mu\\) and is very common notation for the poplation value (the TRUE value!) of the mean of some hypothetical measure. In cell B1, insert some number as the value of \\(\\mu\\). Any number! It can be negative or positive. In cell A2 type “sigma”. sigma is the greek letter \\(\\sigma\\). \\(\\sigma^2\\) is very common (universal!) notation for the population (TRUE) variance of some measure or parameter. Notice that the true (population) values of the mean and variance are greek letters. This is pretty standard in statistics. In cell B2, insert some positive number (standard deviations are the positive square roots of the variance). In cell A8 type the number 1 In cell A9 insert the equation “=A8 + 1”. What is this equation doing? It is adding the number 1 to to the value in the cell above, so the resulting value should be 2. In Cell B8, insert the equation “=normsinv(rand())*$B$2 + $B$1“. The first part of the equation creates a random normal variable with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. multiplication and addition transform this to a random normal variable with mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) (the values you set in cells B1 and B2). copy cell B8 and paste into cell B9. Now Higlight cells A9:B9 and copy the equations down to row 107. You now have 100 random variables sampled from a infinite population with mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\). In cell A4 write “mean 10”. In cell B4 insert the equation “=average(B8:B17)”. The resulting value is the sample mean of the first 10 random variables you created. Is the mean close to \\(\\mu\\)? In cell A5 write “sd 10”. In cell B5 insert the equation “stdev(B8:B17)”. The result is the sample standard deviation of the first 10 random variables. Is this close to \\(\\sigma\\)? In cell A6 write “mean 100”. In cell B6 insert the equation “=average(B8:B107)”. The resulting value is the sample mean of the all 100 random variables you created. Is this mean closer to \\(\\mu\\) than mean 10? In cell A7 write “sd 100”. In cell B7 insert the equation “=stdev(B8:B107)”. The resulting value is the sample standard deviation of the all 100 random variables you created. Is this SD closer to \\(\\sigma\\) than sd 10? The sample standard deviation is a measure of the variability of the sample. The more spread out the sample (the further each value is from the mean), the bigger the sample standard deviation. The sample standard deviation is most often simply known as “The” standard deviation, which is a bit misleading since there are many kinds of standard deviations! Remember that your computed mean and standard deviations are estimates computed from a sample. They are estimates of the true values \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\). Explore the behavior of the sample mean and standard deviation by re-calculating the spreadsheet. In Excel, a spreadsheet is re-calculated by simultaneously pressing the command and equal key. In Google, command-R recalculates but is painfully slow. Instead, if using Google Sheets, just type the number 1 into a blank cell, and the sheet recalculates quickly. Do it again. And again. Each time you re-calculate, a new set of random numbers are generated and the new means and standard deviations are computed. Compare mean 10 and mean 100 each re-calculation. Notice that these estimates are variable. They change with each re-calculation. How variable is mean 10 compared to mean 100? The variability of the estimate of the mean is a measure of uncertainty in the estimate. Are we more uncertain with mean 10 or with mean 100? This variability is measured by a standard deviation. This standard deviation of the mean is also called the standard error of the mean. Many researchers are loose with terms and use “The” standard error to mean the standard error of the mean, even though there are many kinds of standard errors. In general, “standard error”&quot; is abbreviated as “SE.” Sometimes “standard error of the mean” is specifically abbreviated to “SEM.” The standard error of the mean is a measure of the precision in estimating the mean. The smaller the value the more precise the estimate. The standard error of the mean is a standard deviation of the mean. This is kinda weird. If we sample a population one time and compute a mean, how can the mean have a standard deviation? There is only one value! And we compute this value using the sample standard deviation: \\(SEM = \\frac{SD}{\\sqrt{N}}\\). To understand how the SEM is a standard deviation, Imagine recalculating the spread sheet an infinite number of times and each time, you write down the newly computed mean. The standard error of the mean is the standard deviation of this infinitely long column of means. 4.3 Using R to generate fake data to explore uncertainty note that I use “standard deviation” to refer to the sample standard deviation and “standard error” to refer to the standard error of the mean (again, we can compute standard errors as a standard deviation of any kind of estimate) 4.3.1 part I In the exercise above, you used Google Sheets to generate \\(p\\) columns of fake data. Each column had \\(n\\) elements, so the matrix of fake data was \\(n \\times m\\) (it is standard in most fields to specify a matrix as rows by columns). This is much easier to do in R and how much grows exponentially as the size of the matrix grows. To start, we just generate a \\(n \\times p\\) matrix of normal random numbers. # R script to gain some intuition about standard deviation (sd) and standard error (se) # you will probably need to install ggplot2 using library(ggplot2) n &lt;- 6 # sample size p &lt;- 100 # number of columns of fake data to generate fake_data &lt;- matrix(rnorm(n*p, mean=0, sd=1), nrow=n, ncol=p) # create a matrix the 3rd line is the cool thing about R. In one line I’m creating a dataset with \\(n\\) rows and \\(p\\) columns. Each column is a sample of the standard normal distribution which by definition has mean zero and standard deviation of 1. But, and this is important, any sample from this distribution will not have exactly mean zero and standard deviation of 1, because it’s a sample, the mean and standard deviation will have some small errror from the truth. The line has two parts to it: first I’m using the function “rnorm” (for random normal) to create a vector of n*m random, normal deviates (draws from the random normal distribution) and then I’m organizing these into a matrix (using the function “matrix”) To compute the vector of means, standard deviations, and standard errors for each column of fake_data, use the apply() function. means &lt;- apply(fake_data,2,mean) # the apply function is super useful sds &lt;- apply(fake_data,2,sd) sems &lt;- sds/sqrt(n) apply() is a workhorse in many R scripts. Learn it. Know it. Live it. The SEM is the standard deviation of the mean, so let’s see if the standard deviation of the means is close to the true standard error. We sampled from a normal distribution with SD=1 so the true standard is 1/sqrt(n) ## [1] 0.4082483 and the standard deviation of the \\(p\\) means is sd(means) ## [1] 0.3731974 Questions how close is sd(means) to the true SE? change p above to 1000. Now how close is sd(means) to the true SE? change p above to 10,000. Now how close is sd(means) to the true SE? 4.3.2 part II - means This is a visualization of the spread, or variability, of the sampled means qplot(means) ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. Compute the mean of the means mean(means) ## [1] -0.039961 Questions Remember that the true mean is zero. How close, in general, are the sampled means to the true mean. How variable are the means? How is this quantified? change n to 100, then replot. Are the means, in general, closer to the true mean? How variable are the means now? Is the mean estimated with \\(n=100\\) closer to the truth, in general, then the mean estimated with \\(n=6\\)? Redo with \\(n=10000\\) 4.3.3 part III - how do SD and SE change as sample size (n) increases? mean(sds) ## [1] 1.017144 Questions what is the mean of the standard deviations when n=6 (set p=1000) what is the mean of the standard deviations when n=100 (set p=1000) when n = 1000? (set p=1000) when n = 10000? (set p=1000) how does the mean of the standard deviations change as n increases (does it get smaller? or stay about the same size) repeat the above with SEM mean(sems) ## [1] 0.4152472 Congratulations, you have just done a Monte Carlo simulation! 4.3.4 Part IV – Generating fake data with “for loops” n &lt;- 6 # sample size n_iter &lt;- 10^5 # number of iterations of loop (equivalent to p) means &lt;- numeric(n_iter) sds &lt;- numeric(n_iter) sems &lt;- numeric(n_iter) for(i in 1:n_iter){ y &lt;- rnorm(n) # mean=0 and sd=1 are default so not necessary to specify means[i] &lt;- mean(y) sds[i] &lt;- sd(y) sems[i] &lt;- sd(y)/sqrt(n) } sd(means) ## [1] 0.4090702 mean(sems) ## [1] 0.3883867 Questions What do sd(means) and mean(sems) converge to as n_iter is increased from 100 to 1000 to 10,000? Do they converge to the same number? Should they? What is the correct number? Question number 4 is asking what is E(SEM), the “expected standard error of the mean”. There is a very easy formula to compute this. What is it? 4.4 Bootstrapped standard errors The bootstrap is the best invention since duct tape. Really. A standard error is the standard deviation of an infinite number of hypothetically re-sampled means. A bootstrap standard error of a statistic is the standard deviation of the statistic from a finite number of resamples of the data! Wait what? Let’s download some data to explore this concept. The data are archived at Dryad Repository. URL: https://datadryad.org//resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.31cc4 file: RSBL-2013-0432 vole data.xlsx sheet: COLD VOLES LIFESPAN The data are the measured lifespans of the short-tailed field vole (Microtus agrestis) under three different experimental treatments: vitamin E supplementation, vitamin C supplementation, and control (no vitamin supplementation). Vitamins C and E are antioxidants, which are thought to be protective of basic cell function since they bind to the cell-damaging reactive oxygen species that result from cell metabolism. I’ve read in the file using read_excel and converted to a data.table named vole. I used setnames to rename the columns to lifespan, control, vitamin_E, and vitamin_C. The data are in a wide format – that is instead of a single “treatment” column, there are three columns (“control”, “vitamin C”, “vitamin E”) with value = 1, if that row (or lifespan) was assigned the treatment of the column label and zero otherwise. In general, we want data.tables to be in long format. Wide formats can be useful for some computations but not really for these data. Compute the standard error of the mean of the lifespan for the control group using equation (4.2). One simple way to do this for the control group is to extract the subset of the data satisfying the condition control = 1 (the value in the column “control” equals 1). In R, these conditional querries use ==. y &lt;- na.omit(vole[control==1, lifespan]) # subset of data satisfying condition and omitting missing data, if these exist n &lt;- length(y) # the sample size se &lt;- sd(y)/sqrt(n-1) # standard error of the mean Okay, the SEM using equation (4.2) is 31.9.

Remarkably, they even showed that perceived (but not actual) density results in faster growing pups. To begin to investigate how pregnant mothers control the future growth rate of pups, the researchers measured the relationship between local squirrel density and the amount of fecal cortisol metabolites from pregnant mothers. Cortisol is a hormone that is secreted as part of stress response. The researchers were interested in cortisol because it had previously been shownt that, in mammals, blood cortisol levels in pregnant mothers have numerous effects on offspring long past birth. If increased squirrel density causes increased blood cortisol levels then we would expect to find a positive relationship between \\(Density\\) and Figure 5.1: A scatterplot of Fecal cortisol matabolites and squirrel density. Figure 5.1 is a scatterplot of the data with the amount of cortisol metabolites in the feces on the \\(Y\\) axis and local squirrel density on the \\(X\\) axis. The line through the data is a graphical representation of a linear model fit to the data and the gray cloud around the line is a graphical representation of the uncertainty in the model. The researchers wanted to model the “effect” of squirrel density on the amount of cortisol metabolites in the feces of the pregnant mothers. Graphically, this effect is the slope of the line in Figure 5.1. The model fit to the data is \\[\\begin{equation} FCM_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 Density_i + \\varepsilon_i \\tag{5.1} \\end{equation}\\] which contains both the linear predictor and the error. For inference, for example, computing standard errors of the coefficients, We need to model the error. Here, we use the simplest model of error which is “IID \\(N(0, \\sigma)\\)”. This means, the modeled error is Independent – individual error values are independent of other values. Identical – individual error can be thought of as a sample from a single random distribution (the same for each individual value). For this model, this distribution is \\(N(0, \\sigma)\\) – the modeled distribution is “Normal” or “Gaussian”, with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of \\(\\sigma\\). The predictor part of the model is \\[\\begin{equation} \\textrm{E}[FCM|Density] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 Density \\tag{5.2} \\end{equation}\\] In words, model (5.2) reads “the expected value of \\(FCM\\) conditional on density is beta-knot plus beta-one times density”. An expected value is a long run average – if we were to sample lots and lots of red squirrel populations with \\(Density=x\\) (where \\(x\\) is a specific value), we’d expect the average \\(FCM\\) across these samples to be \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\). Let’s unpack this. \\(\\textrm{E}[Y]\\) is the expectation or expected value of \\(Y\\). An expection is the long-run average of \\(Y\\) if we were to run an experiment or re-sample a population many times. The sample mean of \\(Y\\) is an estimate of \\(\\textrm{E}[Y]\\). \\(\\textrm{E}[Y|X]\\) is a conditional expectation of \\(Y\\) – it is the expectation given additional conditions. Using the red squirrel example, these conditions are a specific value of \\(Density\\). If \\(FCM\\) is linearly related to \\(Density\\) (the right-hand side of equation (5.2)) then the expected value of \\(FCM\\) given a local density of 2.8 squirrels differs from the expected value of \\(FCM\\) given a local density of 1.4 squirrels (the units of \\(Density\\) are squirrels per 150 meter radius of the individual female’s midden). In model (5.2), there is a single \\(X\\) variable (\\(FCM\\)). While the \\(X\\) variables are often called the “dependent” variables, in this model \\(FCM\\) does not “depend” on the independent variable \\(Density\\) in any causal sense – meaning if I were to intervene and set \\(Density\\) to some value \\(x\\), I would expect \\(FCM\\) to equal \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\). Rather, \\(FCM\\) only “depends” on \\(Density\\) in a probablistic sense – if \\(Density = x\\) then the most probable value of \\(FCM\\) is \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\). With some strong assumptions model (5.2) can be turned into a model of causal dependency, which is the focus of chapter xxx. \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) are the parameters of model (5.2). Specifically \\(\\beta_0\\) is the model intercept and \\(\\beta_1\\) is the modeled effect of \\(Density\\). Again, the effect (\\(\\beta_1\\)) has a probabilistic, and not causal, interpretation. This interpretation is \\[\\begin{equation} \\beta_1 = \\textrm{E}[FCM|Density=x+1] - \\textrm{E}[FCM|Density=x] \\tag{5.3} \\end{equation}\\] Or, in words, “beta-1 is the expected value of FCM when density equals x + 1 minus the expected value of FCM when the density equals x.” \\(\\beta_1\\) is simply the difference in expected values given a one unit difference in \\(Density\\). A very short way to state this is “\\(\\beta_1\\) is a difference in conditional means”. 5.1.1 Using a linear model to estimate explanatory effects The goal of the statistical model here is to estimate \\(\\beta_1\\) – the probabalistic effect of \\(Density\\) on \\(FCM\\). This estimate, and a measure of the uncertainty of this estimate, are in the table of coefficients of the fit model Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|) (Intercept) 736.0 331.9 2.2 0.0281 Density 671.1 178.9 3.8 0.0002 where the entries in the column “Estimate” are estimates of the parameters \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) in model (5.2). The entries in the column “Std. Error” are the standard errors (SE) of the estimates, which are measures of the uncertainty of the estimates. The parameter estimates in the table above are the coefficients of the fitted model \\[\\begin{equation} FCM_i = b_0 + b_1 Density_i + e_i \\tag{5.4} \\end{equation}\\] where the subscript i refers to the ith individual. The coefficients \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\) are the y-intercept and the slope of the line in Figure 5.1. The coefficient for \\(Density\\) (\\(b_1\\)) is 671.1, and (given the definition of the parameter \\(\\beta_1\\) in equation (5.3)) we expect squirrel mothers with a local density of 2 squirrels within a 150 m radius of her midden to average 671.1 more units of FCM (ng of fecal cortical metabolites per gram dry food) than mother squirrels with a local density of only 1 squirrel within a 150 m radius of her midden. 5.1.1.1 Probabilistic vs. causal conditioning Remember that this coefficient is estimating a probabilistic parameter. Consequently, the coefficient \\(b_1\\) is simply a descriptor of a pattern of relationship between local density and fecal cortisol metabolites - no causal effect is implied. With the strong assumptions explained in chapter xxx, however, \\(b_1\\) can estimate a causal effect. 5.1.2 Using a linear model for prediction Model (5.4) gives the measured value of FCM for each squirrel. The equation includes the linear predictor (\\(b_0 + b_1 Density_i\\)) and the residual from the predictor (\\(e_i\\)). The predictor part is called “predictor” because it is the equation for predicting the value of an individual’s \\(FCM\\) given that individual’s value of \\(Density\\): \\[\\begin{equation} \\widehat{FCM} = b_0 + b_1 Density \\tag{5.5} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\widehat{FCM}\\) is read as “FCM hat” and is the predicted value or simply “prediction”. Very often, we use the predictor part (equation (5.5)) to predict unknown or future values given different modeled inputs (the \\(X\\)). 5.1.3 Reporting results The authors of the squirrel fcm data published a figure and table similar to fig. xxx and table above but used a slightly more complex linear model. Here is how the author’s reported the results: Across 6 years (2006 to 2011), we found a positive relationship between local density and concentrations of fecal cortisol metabolites [FCM; t\\(_155\\) = 3.63, P = 0.0002 (table S4 and Fig. 3A)]. I would advocate reporting the estimate and a confidence interval instead of \\(t\\) and \\(p\\). For example “Across 6 years (2006 to 2011), the probabilistic effect of local density on fecal cortisol metabolites is 671.1 (95% CI: 317.7, 1024.5). If a \\(p\\)-value is report in addition to the effect and CI, always report the exact p-value, which emphasizes the continuous nature of evidence against the null, and not something like”\\(p &lt; 0.05\\)“, which artificially dichotomizes the evidence against the null. 5.2 Working in R 5.2.1 Exploring the bivariate relationship between Y and X Questions Import the “FCM data dryad.csv” data from the Dryad repository as the data.table fcm How are different words in the column labels demarcated? Is this good practice? Here we want to fit a model of FCM.ng.g.dry as a function of Raw.Squirrel.Density. The authors used prior knowledge to expect a positive relationship between these two variables. Use qplot to generate a scatterplot of \\(FCM\\) against \\(Density\\) Questions Is there a trend? If so, does the trend look linear or non-linear? Does the residual variation (the deviation from the trend on the \\(Y\\) axis) look homogenous along the \\(X\\)-axis? Are there any obvious outliers? 5.2.2 Fitting the linear model We will fit a linear model to the data using the lm function, which is very general and will be our workhorse throughout the class. The minimal input to the function is a model formula and the name of the data.frame (remember, a data.table is a data.frame). A formula is of the form Y ~ X. All of the output we assign to the object fit. Let’s fit the linear model to the data using density as the predictor fit &lt;- lm(FCM.ng.g.dry ~ Raw.Squirrel.Density, data=fcm) R will look for the specified \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\) variables in the column names of fcm. If these are not found, R will return an error, for example fit &lt;- lm(FCM_ng_g_dry ~ Raw_Squirrel_Density, data=fcm) will return the error “Error in eval(predvars, data, env) : object ‘FCM_ng_g_dry’ not found”. This means your spelling and capitalization have to be exact! 5.2.3 Getting to know the linear model: the summary function The lm function returns an lm object, which we’ve assigned to the name fit. fit contains lots of information about our fit of the linear model to the data. Most of the information that we want for most purposes can be retrieved with the summary function, which is a general-purpose R command the works with many R objects. summary(fit) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = FCM.ng.g.dry ~ Raw.Squirrel.Density, data = fcm) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -2107.5 -1108.3 -434.9 511.8 8186.8 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

This is the model that was fit Residuals. This is a summary of the distribution of the residuals. From this one can get a sense of the distribution (for inference, the model assumes a normal distribution with mean zero). More useful ways to examine this distribution will be introduced later in this chapter. Coefficients table. This contains the linear model coefficients and their standard error and associated \\(t\\) and \\(p\\) values. The column of values under “Estimate” are the coefficients of the fitted model (equation (5.4)). Here, 735.9604344 is the intercept (\\(b_0\\)) and 671.1379749 is the effect of \\(Density\\) (\\(b_1\\)). The column of values under “Std. Error” are the standard errors of the coefficients. The column of values under “t value” are the t-statistics for each coefficient. A \\(t\\)-value is a signal to noise ratio. The coefficient \\(b_1\\) is the “signal” and the SE is the noise. Get used to thinking about this ratio. Any \\(t\\) less than 2 is indicative of too much noise to say much about the signal. A \\(t\\) between 2 and 3 means the noise is large enough to suggest an effect. A \\(t\\) greater than 3 is pretty good evidence of an effect. The column of values under “Pr(&gt;|t|)” is the \\(p\\)-value, which is the exact probability associated with a particular \\(t\\). What is the \\(p\\)-value a test of? The \\(p\\)-value tests the hypothesis ``how probable are the data if the coefficient is zero?’’. Formally \\(P = \\mathrm{freq(t&#39; \\ge t|H_o)}\\), where \\(t&#39;\\) is the hypothetical t-value, t is the observed \\(t\\)-value, and \\(H_o\\) is the null hypothesis. We will return to \\(p\\)-values in Chapter xxx. Signif. codes. I am surprised that base R returns this. These are useless because the concept of “levels of significance” is muddled, as will be discussed in Chapter xxx. Beneath the Signif. codes are some model statistics which are useful Residual standard error This is \\(\\sqrt{\\sum{e_i^2}/(n-2)}\\), where \\(e_i\\) are the residuals in the fitted model. “degrees of freedom” is the number of \\(e_i\\) that are “allowed to vary” after fitting the parameters, so is the total sample size (\\(n\\)) minus the number of parameters fit. The fit model has two fit parameters (\\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\) so the df is \\(n-2\\). Note that this is the denominator in the residual standard error equation. Multiple R-squared. This is an important but imperfect summary measure of the whole model that effectively measures how much of the total variance in the response variable “is explained by” the model. Its value lies between zero and 1. It’s a good measure to report in a manuscript. F-statistic and p-value. These are statistics for the whole model (not the individual coefficients) and I just don’t find these very useful. Note that the \\(p\\)-value for the coefficient for Raw.Squirrel.Density is very small and we could conclude that the data are not consistant with a model of no slope. But did we need a formal hypothesis test for this? We haven’t learned much if we have only learned that the slope is “not likely to be exactly zero”. What we want to know is not if there is a relationship between \\(FCM\\) and \\(Density\\), which is imperfectly answered with a \\(p\\)-value, but the sign and magnitude of the relationship and the uncertainty in this estimate. For this, we don’t need the \\(p\\)-value. Instead, we want to interpret the coefficient to its SE directly (for a quick-and-dirty interpretation) or the confidence interval of the effect (for a more formal interpretation). Please read this paragraph again. We will come back to it over and over. 5.2.4 display: An alternative to summary Much of what we want to know about a model fit is returned by the display function from the arm package. display(fit) ## lm(formula = FCM.ng.g.dry ~ Raw.Squirrel.Density, data = fcm) ## coef.est coef.se ## (Intercept) 735.96 331.94 ## Raw.Squirrel.Density 671.14 178.90 ## --- ## n = 156, k = 2 ## residual sd = 1732.02, R-Squared = 0.08 The display function does not give a \\(t\\)-value or a \\(p\\)-value of the coefficients because the authors of the arm package do not think \\(p\\)-values are very valuable. We don’t need a \\(t\\) because one can mentally compute the approximate ratio of the coefficient to its SE and get a sense of the signal to noise, and that’s all the authors of the display function think we need. 5.2.5 Confidence intervals Confidence intervals for the coefficients of the model are obtained by confint(fit) ## 2.5 % 97.5 % ## (Intercept) 80.21785 1391.703 ## Raw.Squirrel.Density 317.73057 1024.545 confint returns by default the 95% confidence interval (CI) of all parameters. The most useful way of thinking about the meaning of a CI is A confidence interval contains the range of parameter values that are consistent with the data, in the sense that a \\(t\\)-test would not reject the null hypothesis of a difference between the estimate and any value within the interval A more textbook way of defining a CI is: A 95% CI of a parameter has a 95% probability of including the true value of the parameter. It does not mean that there is a 95% probability that the true value lies in the interval. This is a subtle but important difference. Here is a way of thinking about the proper meaning of the textbook definition: we don’t know the true value of \\(\\beta_1\\) but we can 1) repeat the experiment or sampling, 2) re-estimate \\(\\beta_1\\), and 3) re-compute a 95% CI. If we do 1-3 many times, 95% of the CIs will include \\(\\beta_1\\) within the interval. Confidence intervals are often interpreted like \\(p\\)-values. That is, the researcher looks to see if the CI overlaps with zero and if it does, concludes there is “no effect”. First, this conclusion is not correct – the inability to find sufficient evidence for an effect does not mean there is no effect, it simply means there is insufficient evidence to conclude there is an effect! Second, what we want to use the CI for is to guide us about how big or small the effect might reasonably be, given the data. Again, A CI is a measure of parameter values that are “consistent” with the data. If our biological interpretations at the small-end and at the big-end of the interval’s range radically differ, then we don’t have enough precision in our analysis to reach an unambiguous conclusion. Remember this. 5.2.6 How good is our model? How well does variation in \\(Density\\) “explain” variation in \\(FCM\\)? The answer to this is in the \\(R^2\\) value, which is given in display(fit) and in summary(fit) and accessed directly with summary(fit)$r.squared ## [1] 0.08373756 \\(R^2\\) is the fraction of the total variance of \\(Y\\) explained by the model, or more specifically, the linear predictor. It will vary from zero (the model explains nothing) to one (the model explains everything). If \\(R^2=0\\) the response is completely unpredictable by the predictors. We can think of the values of the response as white noise or all error. This doesn’t mean that the values are “not caused” or “random” or not predicted by some other variable. It only means the values are random with respect to the \\(X\\) variable(s) in the model. If \\(R^2=1\\) we can exactly predict the response from the \\(X\\) variables in the model. So the bigger the \\(R^2\\), the better the model in the sense that the response is more predicatable. Super importantly, “explains” is in a probabilistic and not causal sense. We will explore this concept much more in future worksheets. plot is a very useful base R function for “model checking” or “model diagnostics” to see if our model fit is acceptable. plot(fit) Compare the four diagnostic plots using the guidelines from here http://data.library.virginia.edu/diagnostic-plots/ Questions Look at the plots you just made. What is a residual? What is a fitted value? 5.2.7 exploring a lm object fit contains much information but simply typing fit into the console gives us only the model and the coefficients. names is a super important R function. It gives us the names of all the parts of some R object. fit is an lm object. names(fit) gives us all the parts contained in an lm object. names(fit) ## [1] &quot;coefficients&quot; &quot;residuals&quot; &quot;effects&quot; &quot;rank&quot; ## [5] &quot;fitted.values&quot; &quot;assign&quot; &quot;qr&quot; &quot;df.residual&quot; ## [9] &quot;na.action&quot; &quot;xlevels&quot; &quot;call&quot; &quot;terms&quot; ## [13] &quot;model&quot; You can see any of these parts using the dollar sign Questions What does fit$residuals return? Answer using equation (5.4) What does fit$fitted.values return? Answer using equation @ref(eq:fcmi You can use qplot to make a plot similar to the first plot of plot(fit) qplot(fit$fitted.values, fit$residuals, geom=c(&#39;point&#39;, &#39;smooth&#39;)) ## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;loess&#39; and formula &#39;y ~ x&#39; 5.3 Problems Using the chick data from Chapter 3. Compare the effects of nest_temperature_above_ambient on day13_mass by fitting two separate linear models 1) one using only the control group and one using the treated group. The grouping variable is playback_treatment. These models were plotted in Chapter 3 so lm will return the linear model behind these plots.
