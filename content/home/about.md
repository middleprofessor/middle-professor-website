# Biography

I am a Professor of Biological Sciences at the University of Southern Maine. My research background is in evolutionary and ecological morphology, whole-animal performance, and biomechanics of swimming and flying. Most of my current research is in statistical best practices applied to problems in ecology and physiology /cell biology. These research problems are largely motivated by the classes that I teach, which include the Ecology/Evolution/Diversity semester of our Introductory Biology sequence, Human Physiology (a year-long sequence for Biology majors), and Applied Biostatistics.
