<p>These material properties are</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Stiffness</strong>, aka the Modulus of Elasticity, the Elastic Modulus, or Young’s Modulus, is the slope of the stress strain curve, which is <span class="math inline">\(E = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon}\)</span> for a material with a linear curve. <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is a measure of the resistance to deformation. I usually just refer to this measure as the material’s . The more force it takes to deform a material a certain amount, the higher the elastic modulus. Or from the view of the material, the elastic modulus is high if only a small strain creates a high stress. A material with a high elastic modulus is <strong>stiff</strong>. The opposite, a material with a low elastic modulus, is <strong>compliant</strong>. Compliant materials are easily stretched or squished.</li>
<li><strong>Strength</strong>, or breaking strength, or tensile strength (if in tension), is the maximum stress that a material can resist without , or breaking. A <strong>strong</strong> material can withstand high stress before failure. The opposite is <strong>weak</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Deformability</strong> is the strain of the material at failure. If the material is in tension, this is <strong>extensability</strong>. All highly deformable materials are compliant but not all compliant materials are highly deformable.</li>
<li><strong>Toughness</strong>, T, is the strain energy density at failure. Materials that can absorb lots of strain energy are tough. The opposite is brittle. Stiff materials tend to be brittle. More compliant (but not too compliant!) materials tend to be tough. Bones used for support (and the wood of tree trunks) must be tough in addition to being strong.</li>
<li><strong>Resilience</strong>, R, is the percent of the total absorbed strain energy that can be used to do work and so is the ratio of the released strain energy (<span class="math inline">\(U_{out}\)</span>, the area under the unloading curve) to the total absorbed strain energy (<span class="math inline">\(U_{in}\)</span>, the area under the loading curve). This ratio is always less than one (otherwise a ball made of a material with a resilience of one could bounce forever!). The ability of a tissue to store-and-release elastic strain energy is a function of both resilience and compliance. Collagen and elastin are both very resilient but collagen is also much stiffer than elastin.</li>
