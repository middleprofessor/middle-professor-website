# Blood

# What does our immune system respond to?

# Immune
## Overview
* innate is fast, weak, non-specific, innate, and has no memory
* adaptive is slow, strong, specific, adaptive, and has memory

Innate is fast because there are abundant innate cells (neutrophils, macrophages, etc.) and molecules (complement, interferons, etc.) that are constantly present in sufficient numbers for response. Adaptive is slow because the cell lineages that recognize the antigen (T and B cells) have to grow, to create sufficient numbers for an effective response

Innate is weak because it less able to clear an infection. Adaptive is strong because it more able to clear an infection.

Innate is non-specific because its proteins (pattern recognition receptors including toll-like receptors, complement, etc.) are specific to general classes of pathogen molecules that are common to many different species. Adaptive is specific because its proteins (T and B cell receptors, antibody) are specific to molecules call antigen that is specific not just to specific species of pathogen but also to specific strains of species.

Innate is innate because the agents (cells and molecules) are present and do not adapt -- or, not change in response (other than being activated) -- to the specific infectious organism. Adaptive is adaptive because it adapts to the specific infectious organism. Cell lineages specific to the strain grow and even the TCR and BCR modify in ways that increase affinity to antigen.

Innate has no memory. Adaptive has memory, which is the property of retaining information from previous exposure that allows the response to be faster and bigger upon re-exposure. This memory is specified in specialized lymphocytes call memory cells.

## Innate

1. Vocab
    * [diapedesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukocyte_extravasation) - the movement of a WBC from blood to tissue by squeezing between endothelial cells. A step of leukocyte extravasation.
        * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB9FYAo7SJU
    * chemotaxis
        * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUUfdP87Ssg
        * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb-m1uDoWfU (this is awesome)

2. Cellular response
    * neutrophils - inflammatory responder, phagocytocytic
        * https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2016/11/404936/science-focus-how-do-white-blood-cells-move-so-fast
    * eosinophils - multicellular parasite responder, also allergies. secrete oxidants, which can also cause tissue damage in inflammation
    * basophils/mast cells - promote inflammation by secretion of heparin and histamine. IgE receptors promote allergic reactions.
    * macrophages - highly variable. phagocytic. antigen presentation.
    * NK cells - immune surveillance of virus-infected and tumorogenic cells. Secrete perforin (creates pores in host cell), apoptotic stimulators and more. Cause apoptosis and probably lysis in target cell (which is a host cell not a bacteria)
    * dendritic cells -- phagocytic. hang out in periphery and phagocytose then process and present antigen on MHC class II. Migrate to secondary lymph tissue to present antigent to T cells
    
3. Molecular response
    * complement
    * interferons
    
## Adaptive

### Players

1. helper T cells (Th cells), also called CD4+ because they express the CD4 protein on the plasma membrane. Th cells kickstart the adaptive immune response but do not kill anything directly. Kickstart by activating Tc and B cells.
2. cytotoxic T cells (Tc cells), also called CD8+ because they express CD8 protein on the plasma membrane. Tc cells are the response to virus and tumorogenic cells. 
3. B cells, which differentiate into plasma cells. Plasma cells are antibody secreting. B/plasma cells are the response to bacteria and promote inflammation.

### T cells are activated by binding to an antigen presenting cell (APC) that presents the antigen bound to an MHC protein

MHC is a protein that is transported to plasma membrane. During post-translational modification in ER, protein fragments are attached to MHC and these protein fragments are "presented" at the cell's surface. These proteins are how the immune cells recognize a cell as "self"

some vocab

1. self -- refers to host, so "self protein fragment" is any protein fragment from the proteins made by host.
2. non-self -- refers to forign, so "non-self protein fragment" is any protein fragment from the proteins made by another individual. This other individual could be another human, or a bacteria, or virus, and even applies to tumorogenic cells.
3. endogenous -- refers to a molecule synthesized inside the cell. This is not equal to self. Viral protein made inside a cell is endogenous.
4. exogennous -- refers to a molecule synthesized outside of the cell. Generally exogenous proteins are from bacteria or transplanted tissue.


1. MHC II - expressed on dendritic cells, macrophages, B cells. These cell
