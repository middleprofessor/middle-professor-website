# What does our immune system respond to?

# Immune
## Overview
* innate is fast, weak, non-specific, innate, and has no memory
* adaptive is slow, strong, specific, adaptive, and has memory

Innate is fast because there are abundant innate cells (neutrophils, macrophages, etc.) and molecules (complement, interferons, etc.) that are constantly present in sufficient numbers for response. Adaptive is slow because the cell lineages that recognize the antigen (T and B cells) have to grow, to create sufficient numbers for an effective response

Innate is weak because it less able to clear an infection. Adaptive is strong because it more able to clear an infection.

Innate is non-specific because its proteins (pattern recognition receptors including toll-like receptors, complement, etc.) are specific to general classes of pathogen molecules that are common to many different species. Adaptive is specific because its proteins (T and B cell receptors, antibody) are specific to molecules call antigen that is specific not just to specific species of pathogen but also to specific strains of species.

Innate is innate because the agents (cells and molecules) are present and do not adapt -- or, not change in response (other than being activated) -- to the specific infectious organism. Adaptive is adaptive because it adapts to the specific infectious organism. Cell lineages specific to the strain grow and even the TCR and BCR modify in ways that increase affinity to antigen.

Innate has no memory. Adaptive has memory, which is the property of retaining information from previous exposure that allows the response to be faster and bigger upon re-exposure. This memory is specified in specialized lymphocytes call memory cells.

## Innate

1. Vocab
    * [diapedesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukocyte_extravasation) - the movement of a WBC from blood to tissue by squeezing between endothelial cells. A step of leukocyte extravasation.
        * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB9FYAo7SJU
    * chemotaxis
        * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUUfdP87Ssg
        * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb-m1uDoWfU (this is awesome)

2. Cellular response
    * neutrophils - inflammatory responder, phagocytocytic
        * https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2016/11/404936/science-focus-how-do-white-blood-cells-move-so-fast
    * eosinophils - multicellular parasite responder, also allergies. secrete oxidants, which can also cause tissue damage in inflammation
    * basophils/mast cells - promote inflammation by secretion of heparin and histamine. IgE receptors promote allergic reactions.
    * macrophages - highly variable. phagocytic. antigen presentation.
    * NK cells - immune surveillance of virus-infected and tumorogenic cells. Secrete perforin (creates pores in host cell), apoptotic stimulators and more. Cause apoptosis and probably lysis in target cell (which is a host cell not a bacteria)
    * dendritic cells -- phagocytic. hang out in periphery and phagocytose then process and present antigen on MHC class II. Migrate to secondary lymph tissue to present antigent to T cells
    
3. Molecular response
    * complement
    * interferons
