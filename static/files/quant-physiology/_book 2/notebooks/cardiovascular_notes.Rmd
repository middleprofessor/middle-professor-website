Notes on confusions

# Percent change

Question #3 asks how flow changes if "the radius of the lumen of an arteriole leading into a capilary **increases 50%**"

Many students are confused by the phrase "increases 50%"

1. if something increases 50%, it gets bigger. This may be confusing since 50% is less than 100% but the phrase is "increased 50%" so it has to get bigger

2. a 50% increase is 1.5X the original amount. We would call 1.5 "the multiple"

3. A 100% increase is 2X the original amount (a 100% increase is a doubling) - this is confusing because the *percent increase is the multiple minus 1*.

If I increase your hourly wage by 50% and your wage is $10 per hour your new wage is $10 per hour X 1.5 = $15.00 per hour

If our company is now having financial problems and I decrease your wage 50% then your wage is $15 per hour X 0.5 = $7.50 dollars per hour (it is halved).

Note that a 50% decrease after a 50% increase doesn't get us back to the original amount!

General equation: percent change = (new - old)/old * 100

# What is the meaning of $\Delta P$?
Almost anytime you see the Greek capital letter "delta" in science, this will mean a "change" in something. And this change is an *difference* (a - b) not a ratio (a/b). In the equation for Flow, $\Delta P$ is the difference in pressure at some upstream point minus some downstream point $P_{upstream} - P_{downstream}$.

# How to make sense of units of viscosity from wikipedia's definition of viscosity

>Viscosity is the material property which relates the viscous stresses in a material to the rate of change of a deformation (the strain rate)

The phrase "relates to" implies how Y (viscous stresses) changes with X (strain rate) so this sentence turned into an equation is "stress over strain rate".

A "rate" of something is always that something divided by time (and a rate is the first time derivative of that something, which is why we learn calculus), so "stress over strain rate", is

\begin{align}
\frac{\sigma}{\frac{\varepsilon}{Time}}
\end{align}

In fundamental measures this is

\begin{align}
\frac{Force/Area}{1/Time}
\end{align}

which can be rearranged to
\begin{align}
Force/Area \cdot Time
\end{align}

And if we are using SI units then the units of $Force/Area \cdot Time$ is Pa$\cdot$s

The reason why $\frac{\varepsilon}{Time} = 1/Time$ is because $\varepsilon$ is unitless. If it were in a denominator, we could ignore it, but it's in the numerator of $\frac{\varepsilon}{Time}$ so we just use the number 1.

Finally, many students simply used strain and not stain rate. Strain rate is simply the rate that an object is deforming. If I stretch bubble gum slowly, the strain rate is small. If I stetch it quickly, the strain rate is high. Rates are super important in biology...Flow is a rate, Power is a rate, O2 consumption is a rate.

# R in the $Flow = \frac{\Delta P}{R}$ is "resistance" not "radius" and this makes a huge difference

# The change in flow is a much simpler problem than the approach taken by most students

> The radius of the lumen of an arteriole leading into a capilary increases 50%. What is the change in blood flow?

This change is $F_{new}$ - $F_{old}$ 

Most students "parameterized" the equation for flow by looking up real numbers of pressure and viscosity and length, etc. This isn't wrong, especially since I didn't give any hints about how to solve it, but a full parameterization (plugging in numbers to all the variables) isn't necessary, and may get in the way of the general understanding of how the radius effects resistance and in turn flow.

The only thing changing is the radius of the lumen of the arteriole, so the problem is simplified by calculating its effect alone: $Flow \propto 1/R$ and $R \propto 1/r^4$. Operationally, we treat the "proportional to" just like an equal sign so if we put this together we get $Flow \propto r^4$, that is flow increases with radius to the fourth power. Since the radius increase 50%, this is 1.5X the original radius, so the new flow is $(1.5)^4$=5.0625X the old flow.

If this explanation skipped too many steps, here is the long version:

\begin{align}
F_2 &= \frac{\Delta P}{\frac{8\mu \ell}{\pi r_2^4}}\\
r_2 &= 1.5r_1, \quad \mathrm{so}\\
F_2 &= \frac{\Delta P}{\frac{8\mu \ell}{\pi (1.5r_1)^4}}\\
(1.5r_1)^4 &= r_1^4 1.5^4, \quad \mathrm{so}\\
F_2 &= \frac{\Delta P}{\frac{8\mu \ell}{\pi r_1^4 1.5^4}}\\
&=\frac{\Delta P}{R_1 \cdot \frac{1}{1.5^4}}\\
&=F_1 \cdot (1.5)^4
\end{align}

Take the time to understand the logic of these steps. The importance of this is, it doesn't matter how you parameterize $\ell$ and $\mu$ and $P$...the increase in flow will always be $1.5^4$ if the radius is the only thing changing and it is increasing 50%.
