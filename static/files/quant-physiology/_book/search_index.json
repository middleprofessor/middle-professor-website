["blood.html", "Problem Set 1 Blood 1.1 How to solve an estimation problem 1.2 Problem set", " Problem Set 1 Blood Goals: back-of-the-envelope estimation, scale, google search Many complex problems in biology can be broken down into a series of smaller problems and a common smaller problem is the estimation of some number, such as the number of bacteria per cell. Estimation problems range from back-of-the-envelope estimations that are imprecise but useful in that they give one a general sense of the magnitude of a phenomenon to more precisely modeled estimates that are used for making decisions under uncertainty. Back-of-the-envelope estimations are called that because most can, literally, be done with a pencil and the back of an envelope. They can be done with pencil because the computations uses rounded instead of exact numbers like 10 or 300 that are easily multiplied/divided. In this module, you will compute some back-of-the-envelope estimations. A problem like “how many bacteria can colonize a cell” depends on the distribution of the sizes of the bacteria, the size of the cell, and how packed the cell is with its own molecules and organelles. Here, I simply want to get you started on addressing a problem like this with very simple models of the problem. Along the way, solving the problem should give you a sense of scale of what it is like to be a bacterium or a virus living in a cellular world. 1.1 How to solve an estimation problem I’ll solve an analogous problem: How many beach balls can fit in a barn? If a barn has Volume \\(V_{barn}\\) and a beach ball has volume \\(V_{ball}\\) then the number of balls that could fit into the barn would be approximately, \\(N_{balls} = \\frac{V_{barn}}{V_{ball}}\\). To solve this, I need to paramaterize the model by assigning numbers to these variables. And, the answer is dependent on what numbers I choose for the size of the beach balls and the shape and size of the barn and how filled the barn is with hay (or furniture or horses or whatever) – that is how much of the volume of the barn is available for beach balls. A back-of-the-envelope calculation simply uses a reasonable value for the parameters. So, here are my numbers. the barn is a typical vermont barn. I have a sense of what “typical” is because I live in New England and see barns every day. But what if I were a martian, and had never seen a barn? Then I would need to find this information from a reliable source. So, to find “typical”, I used a google search and found what looks like a reputable source that says a typical hay barn is 30 feet wide by 40 feet long. I estimated wall height from the figure as half the width and I used a 12/12 pitch for the roof, so the peak is centered and 15 feet (half of the width) high. Again – if you don’t have to look up information to parameterize your model, don’t! I used a big beach ball of 2 feet in diameter (because big beach balls are fun). I didn’t need to look this up! 10% of the barn is filled with hay. I use Google Sheets to compute the number of balls for each room (the main room and the attic) and then add these. Here is my sheet Figure 1.1: Estimation of maximum number of beach balls that could colonize a barn. Cells in red are computed. My column labels include the units of the measure. Do not add units to the measure itself because this makes the format of the cell “text” instead of “number” and you cannot refer to the cell in an equation. I also cite the source of the parameterization below the table (I cite the source for the size of the barn. The size of the beach ball I just made up). 1.2 Problem set Do these on the same sheet. Name the sheet “1. Blood”. How many red blood cells in a drop of blood? Note, I don’t want you to look up how many RBCs are in a drop, I want you to estimate it using a back-of-the-envelope estimation. You don’t need to look up the volume of a drop of water if you are able to use available information in your head to derive a reasonable volume for a drop of water. For the next three questions, assume the host cell is “empty”, that is, it contains no organelles or molecules that take up space. How many bacteria could colonize a red blood cell? How many bacteria could colonize a macrophage? How many virus particles could colonize a red blood cell? – These should all be on the same google sheet. – Do not hardcode parameters, that is, if a virus is 30 feet wide do not put “30” in an equation but instead make your equations reference the cell with this information. – You may need to google search information to parameterize the model, such as, how big a virus is. Part of the goal of this is for you to develop your skills finding reliable information using a google search. There is variation in virus size or cell size so use something in the middle or “typical”. Again – these are back-of-the-envelope estimates so you don’t need to be very precise – in fact all of these problems could be computed by most working biologists without looking up any information. We all have a pretty good sense for how big a virus, a bacterium, a blood cell, and a drop of water is. But you can look up this information because you are at the beginning of your biology career. – Cite a webpage giving the source of the information, as I’ve done for the barns. There is no “right” or “wrong” place to get this information, only more or less reliable. I’m not grading you on where you get it, but I want to see where you get it! And all I want for a citation is the webpage, this is not a formal citation that you put in a scientific paper. "],
["immune.html", "Problem Set 2 Immune 2.1 Combinations 2.2 Problem set", " Problem Set 2 Immune Goals: combinations How many kinds of antibody can a human make by V(D)J recombination? An individual human produces many different antibody proteins, where “different” is amino acid sequence. How is this possible given that there are only a few “antibody” genes? Part of the answer is V(D)J recombination. An antibody is constructed from two pairs of polypeptides. Each pair consists of a light chain and a heavy chain. Each chain has a “variable” region and a “constant” region. The heavy chain is constructed from one gene (located on chromosome 14) while the light chain is constructed from two genes: the light chain locus \\(\\lambda\\) (“lambda”) located on chromosome 22 and the light chain locus \\(\\kappa\\) (“kappa”) located on chromosome 2. The variable region of both light chain loci is composed of a V part and a J part. The variable region of the heavy chain locus is composed of V, D, and J parts. A V, D, or J part consists of multiple copies of the exon that will be spliced into the mRNA but each of these copies has a slightly different nucleotide sequence and some of the copies do not produce functional mRNA. To make the heavy chain mRNA for the antibody Choose one of the copies of the V region of the heavy chain locus. Choose one of the copies of the D region of the heavy chain locus. Choose one of the copies of the J region of the heavy chain locus. combine with the C (constant) region to make the heavy chain mRNA To make the light chain mRNA for the antibody Choose one of the copies of the V region of one (either \\(\\lambda\\) or \\(\\kappa\\)) light chain locus. Choose one of the copies of the J region of the same light chain locus. combine with the C region to make the light chain mRNA. Finally, combine the light and heavy chains (these are actually translated independently and then joined into the protein but the math is the same). So an antibody is a combination of combinations. It is a combination (light + heavy combined) of combinations (V, J, and D combined) 2.1 Combinations If there are n1 elements in set 1 and n2 elements in set 2, how many combinations of 1 element of each set are there? Answer: n1 x n2 In the table below, I use this math to compute the number of antibodies that could be made using only V(D)J recombination. The Figure 2.1: How many kinds of antibodies 2.2 Problem set Do these on the same sheet. Name the sheet “2. Immune” (Ken, Jeff, David, and Doug) is the set of male faculty members in the Biology department. (Chris, Terry, Rachel1, Rachel2, and Rachel3) is the set of female faculty members in the Biology department. If the biology department has a square dance, how many combinations of male-female partners could there be? Write all of these out to confirm (write this in a column of your google sheet) Figure 4.3 in this online textbook is a table containing the number of copies of each of the gene segments. Use this table to compute the number of different antibodies that can be synthesized using V(D)J recombination alone. "],
["cardiovascular.html", "Problem Set 3 Cardiovascular 3.1 Background 3.2 Problems", " Problem Set 3 Cardiovascular 3.1 Background This exercise explores equations 12-1 and 12-2 from Vander’s Physiology. Regulation of blood flow is critical to increase or decrease delivery of blood to organs as they need more or less blood. Blood flow can be modeled with the equation for fluid flow used in almost any system (rivers, wind, etc) \\[\\begin{equation} F = \\frac{\\Delta P}{R} \\quad \\small{(12.1)} \\end{equation}\\] \\(F\\) is flow \\(P\\) is pressure. Here, and almost everywhere you’ll see it, \\(\\Delta\\) means “change”, so \\(\\Delta P\\) is a difference in pressure between two points in space. Here this is two point along the length of a blood vessel. It is the difference in pressure that is driving the blood to flow. \\(R\\) is the resistance to flow due to friction. Friction sucks kinetic energy from moving objects (the lost kinetic energy is transformed to heat). Resistance is an important concept in understanding human physiology. Resistance can be modeled using the Poiseuille equation \\[\\begin{equation} R = \\frac{8L\\eta}{\\pi r^4} \\quad \\small{(12.2)} \\end{equation}\\] \\(L\\) is the length of section of blood vessel \\(\\eta\\) (the greek letter “eta”) is the viscosity of the fluid (or more specifically, the dynamic viscosity) \\(r\\) is the radius of the lumen of the vessel. 3.2 Problems Create a sheet named “3. cardiovascular” Create a table like that below. Write down the units of each of the terms. There is no “right” answer, because units can be written different ways. For example I could write the units of volume as L (“liter”) or gallon or L\\(^3\\) (here “L” is length). Write down a definition of each term. Write a formal definition and then add your own interpretation of that definition. For example, Wikipedia defines density as the “mass per unit volume” which I’ll interpret as “the amount of matter in given amount of space”, which doesn’t quite capture the nuances but is helpful for understanding. Also notice that wikipedia’s definition of density here is an equation expressed as words, this can help with thinking about units. The typical units of viscosity, \\(\\mathrm{Pa}\\cdot \\mathrm{s}\\) is not very intuitive. Wikipedia has a nice quasi-definition of viscosity “Viscosity is the material property which relates the viscous stresses in a material to the rate of change of a deformation (the strain rate)”. Using your knowledge of stress and strain from last semester, how would you express quasi-definition in units? Write it as an equation if this helps. Show how the units expressed this way equals \\(\\mathrm{Pa}\\cdot \\mathrm{s}\\). Do this with pencil and paper, snap a photo, and insert it below the table in your Google sheet. Here is an example to follow: While the equation for flow is useful for understanding how variation pressure and resistance causes variation in flow, if I use the equation to define flow, I would get something like “the change in pressure of the fluid per unit resistance”, which isn’t very helpful in thinking about flow. Flow is “the volume of fluid that moves past a point per unit time”. So how do I get from the equation to this definition? I worked this out, snapped a photo, re-sized the image to 800 pixels wide, then inserted the image in my google sheet. The lumen of an arteriole leading into a capilary increases 50%. What is the change in blood flow to the capillary? Use the google sheet to show your work, including all calculations. "],
